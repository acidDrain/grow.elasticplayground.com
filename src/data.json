My passions right now are functional programming (Haskell, OCaml, ReasonML, and dare I say... JavaScript?), cloud, microservices through containerization/serverless/unikernels, continuous delivery by way of automation, and Everything-as-Code.\nI've accumulated a massive breadth of knowledge and experience across networking, information security (network security, application security, and system security), incident response, compliance, cloud, applications and systems architecture, etc..\nI've worked in network/security operations, management (led a team of 14), security architecture, sales (as a Solutions Architect), and led a DevOps team within an R&D organization. I'm at a startup currently, leading our effort to build a solid continuous delivery pipeline as a Site Reliability Engineer. My focus right now is on designing/building/scaling our cloud environment via microservices, continuous delivery pipeline, and developing a platform focused on machine learning. Occasionally, I also assist our professional services team as an SME in InfoSec and DevOps practices."
